Buckle up, you're about to pilot the Helirin Universal Helicopter!  Characterized by its ever-rotating twin wings, you are tasked with navigating through tight corridors and punching away at the enemies to get the best time. In this third entry in the Kururin series, your family is lost on vacation and it's up to you to bring them back.  Your journeys will take you to various locations, and you will get to use many powerful Action Helirin.
